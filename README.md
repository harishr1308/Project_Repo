Detection of Application Layer DDoS Attack by Modeling User Behavior Using Logistic Regression

In this project, an anomaly based statistical pattern recognition method is proposed to detect application layer ddos attacks. From the web server log (Attack and Normal), after preprocessing, an application layer ddos attack dataset is constructed. From the constructed dataset features are extracted. From the extracted feature set some new characteristics are built. Then combining extracted and constructed features a new application layer ddos attack dataset is generated. The new application layer ddos attack dataset is split into two sub datasets, viz., training dataset and testing dataset. This has been done for cross validation to avoid over fitting of results. In this paper, 10 fold cross validation is used. In training phase, the algorithm is trained to detect application layer ddos attack and in testing phase, the algorithm is tested against upcoming traffic.
